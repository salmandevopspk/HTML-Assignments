    <h3>My Family and My Childhood:</h3>
    <p>I’m from a middle-class family of <b>Karachi</b>, I am <b>Salman Khan</b>. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My <B>Father</B> is a respectable businessman in our community. <br>
        My <b>Mother</b> is a doctor. They both love their occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose. <br>
        We are three brothers and sisters. Being the eldest I am the most liable from my brothers and sisters. I am wanted to guide and take care of my other siblings. We all are in the same school. Reading is my passion.</p> <br>
        <b>Thanks</b>
